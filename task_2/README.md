# Task 2 - Guess the number üîç

## Background story

Imagine you are a game developer, and you are asked to create a simple Number Guessing Game where the player has to guess a secret number chosen by the computer. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

## Project requirements

‚û§ How the game works:

1. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 50.

2. The player must guess the number.

3. The player has only 5 attempts to guess correctly.

4. After each guess, the program will tell the player:

   - If the guess is too high,
   - If the guess is too low, or
   - If the guess is correct.

5. If the player guesses correctly, the game ends immediately with a congratulations message.

6. If the player fails to guess the number after 5 tries, the program reveals the correct number.

7. After the end of each game, back to the main menu with option to Start game or Exit.

## Prototype

```
====== Number Guessing Game ======
1. Start Game
2. Exit
Choose an option: 1

I have selected a number between 1 and 50. You have 5 tries.

Attempt 1: Enter your guess: 25
Too low!

Attempt 2: Enter your guess: 40
Too high!

Attempt 3: Enter your guess: 35
Too high!

Attempt 4: Enter your guess: 30
Too low!

Attempt 5: Enter your guess: 33
Congratulations! You guessed it in 5 attempts!

====== Number Guessing Game ======
1. Start Game
2. Exit
Choose an option: ...
```

or if FAILED:

```
Attempt 5: Enter your guess: 45
Too high!
Sorry, you've used all your attempts. The correct number was: 37
```

## Code requirements

1. You are allowed to use library to generate the random number
2. You must implement the following concepts:
   - Input / Output
   - Variable and datatypes
   - While loop / do while loop
   - For loop
   - Switch statement
   - If statement

## Additional Requirement

1. Create a feature branch from `main` for this task, with the format: {your-name}/task-{task-number}/guess-the-number
2. Follow conventional commit naming conventions: conventionalcommits.org
3. Lastly, create a Pull Request from your feature branch into main. Don't merge until you got LGTM from reviewer.
4. Implement clean and modular code.
